🚀 100 Days of Machine Learning Challenge 🧠

Welcome to my 100 Days of Machine Learning challenge! This journey is all about diving deep into the world of machine learning and artificial intelligence, one day at a time, to build a solid foundation and achieve mastery through consistent learning and hands-on projects.
🌟 Why This Challenge?

Machine learning is reshaping the future of technology in ways we could never have imagined. From self-driving cars to predictive models, the power of AI is undeniable. Through this challenge, I aim to:

    Master the core concepts of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
    Get hands-on experience by building real-world projects.
    Prepare myself for future innovations in the tech world.
    Inspire others to take on their own learning journeys.

🎯 Goals

    Learn the fundamentals of machine learning and its applications.
    Implement at least one machine learning project every 10 days.
    Understand and apply machine learning models, including regression, classification, clustering, and deep learning.
    Enhance coding skills with Python, data handling libraries, and machine learning frameworks like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
    Document everything, including code, notes, and project results, in this repository.

🛠️ What I'll Cover

Throughout the challenge, I’ll be focusing on:

    Mathematics & Statistics for Machine Learning: Essential concepts like probability, linear algebra, calculus, and statistics.
    Python Programming: Core Python, libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data handling and visualization.
    Machine Learning Models: Supervised and unsupervised learning models including linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), k-means clustering, and neural networks.
    Deep Learning & Neural Networks: Understanding the basics of neural networks and diving into frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras.
