# Fraud Detection Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to explore patterns in a dataset containing information on individualsâ€™ professions, income, credit card details, and fraud status. Through data exploration and visualization, we seek to understand potential correlations between fraud and various features such as profession and income.

## Dataset Information

- **File**: `Fraud_Data.csv`
- **Columns**: Profession, Income, Credit_card_number, Expiry, Security_code, Fraud

The dataset includes sensitive data; thus, personal details like `Credit_card_number` and `Security_code` were masked for privacy in our analysis.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Dropped sensitive fields (`Credit_card_number` and `Security_code`).
   - Converted `Expiry` to a datetime format for time-based analysis.

2. **Analysis of Fraud Trends**:
   - **Income by Profession**: Bar chart to compare average income across professions.
   - **Fraud Proportion**: Pie chart showing fraud vs. non-fraud cases.
   - **Fraud Rate by Profession**: Count plot of fraud cases within each profession.
   - **Correlation Matrix**: Heatmap to show the correlation between `Income` and `Fraud`.
   - **Expiry Date Insights**: Histogram of expiry years to detect any relation between card expiration dates and fraud incidents.

3. **Visualizations**:
   - **Income by Profession** - Highlights income distribution across different professions.
   - **Fraud Proportion** - Pie chart to illustrate the share of fraud vs. non-fraud cases.
   - **Fraud by Profession** - Shows fraud frequency by profession.
   - **Correlation Heatmap** - Examines the relationship between fraud occurrences and income.
   - **Expiry Date Distribution** - Shows distribution of card expiry dates to spot trends related to fraud.

## How to Use
