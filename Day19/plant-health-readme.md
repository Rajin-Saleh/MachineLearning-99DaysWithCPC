# Plant Health Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes plant health data using various environmental factors to understand the relationships between plant health status and environmental conditions. The analysis includes data visualization, correlation studies, and time-based analysis of different parameters affecting plant health.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Comprehensive data visualization
- Time-series analysis
- Environmental factor correlation studies
- Plant health status analysis
- Statistical summaries

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  ```
  pandas
  matplotlib
  seaborn
  ```

To install the required packages, run:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Dataset
The dataset (`plant_health_data.csv`) includes the following parameters:
- Timestamp
- Plant Health Status
- Soil Moisture
- Ambient Temperature
- Soil Temperature
- Humidity
- Light Intensity
- Soil pH
- Nitrogen Level
- Phosphorus Level
- Potassium Level
- Chlorophyll Content
- Electrochemical Signal

## Analysis Components

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Timestamp validation and conversion
- Missing value handling
- Data type verification

### 2. Visualizations
- Distribution of Plant Health Status
- Correlation Heatmap of Environmental Factors
- Time-based Analysis of Environmental Parameters
- Plant Health vs. Environmental Factors Analysis

### 3. Statistical Analysis
- Basic statistical summaries
- Health status correlations
- Environmental factor relationships

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-health-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd plant-health-analysis
   ```

3. Ensure your data file is in the correct location:
   ```
   Day19/plant_health_data.csv
   ```

4. Run the analysis script:
   ```bash
   python analysis_script.py
   ```

## Output
The script generates:
1. Multiple visualization plots
2. Statistical summaries in the console
3. A cleaned dataset saved as `cleaned_plant_health_data.csv`

## Visualization Examples
The analysis produces several types of visualizations:
- Distribution plots of plant health status
- Correlation heatmaps of environmental factors
- Time series plots of key parameters
- Box plots comparing health status with environmental factors
